# Classify hand-drawn pictures

## To run the code

First clone this project:
`git clone https://github.com/dishiGit/machineLearning.git`
Navigate to the folder 'all' to run the algorithms.
Bellow are instructions to run each algorithm.

### Preprocess image data & baseline

### Backpropagation NN

Run file backPropagation.ipynb cell by cell.
Preprocessing image is included.

### CNN
Ensure that TensorFlow and Keras are installed and activated on the machine.
A new environment might be required since Keras only support up to Python 3.6.


**Those steps can be skipped if Keras is already installed.**

To create a new environment:

`conda create --name trottier`

To activate the new environment:

`activate trottier`

To install Keras and Tensorflow:

`conda install tensorflow`

`conda install keras`

Jupyter Notebook is also needed in the new environment

`conda install jupyter`

Then just launch Keras.ipynb and run it as any other jupyter notebook
